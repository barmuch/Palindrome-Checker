<h1>Palindrome Checker</h1>

## Description
Palindrome Checker is a simple application used to determine whether a word, phrase, or sentence is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a word or phrase that reads the same forwards and backwards, disregarding capitalization, punctuation, and spacing.

## How It Works
The application takes user input and checks whether it is a palindrome or not. The checking process involves removing all non-alphanumeric characters, converting all characters to lowercase, and comparing the input with its reversed version.

## Usage
Users are prompted to input text into the provided input field.
After entering the text, users can click the "Check" button to determine if the text is a palindrome.
The result of the check will be displayed on the screen.
